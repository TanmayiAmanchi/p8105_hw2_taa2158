## Problem 1
This problem focuses on NYC Transit data. Import the NYC Transit CSV.
```{r}
nyc_transit = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
nyc_transit = janitor::clean_names(nyc_transit)
```

Select the required columns
```{r}
nyc_transit <- nyc_transit %>%
  mutate(routes_served = apply(select(.,route1:route11), 1, function(x) paste(na.omit(x), collapse = ", "))) %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada, routes_served) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The variables in the nyc_transit data set are line, station_name, station_longitude, station_latitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada, and routes_served. The cleaning steps performed so far include selecting only the relevant columns, creating a new variable routes_served that consolidates information about the routes served at each station, and converting the entry variable from character strings to logical values. The resulting data set dimensions are 1,868 Ã— 9. This is considered tidy, as each variable is represented by a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table.

Finding how many distinct stations there are  
```{r}
distinct_stations <- nrow(nyc_transit %>% distinct(line, station_name))
distinct_stations
```
According to this code, there are 465 distinct stations in New York City.

Finding how many are ADA compliant
```{r}
ada_compliant_stations <- sum(nyc_transit$ada == TRUE)
ada_compliant_stations
```
According to this code, there are 468 ada compliant stations.

Proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?
```{r}
nyc_transit <- nyc_transit %>%
  mutate(vending = ifelse(vending == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) 

proportion_without_vending <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(vending == FALSE) %>%                              
  summarise(proportion = mean(entry, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%   
  pull(proportion)

proportion_without_vending
```
The output of this code gives us 0.3770492. This means that 37.70% of stations/entrances don't have a vending allow entrance.

```{r}
a_train_stations <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(routes_served == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name)  

num_a_train_stations <- nrow(a_train_stations)

num_ada_compliant_a_train_stations <- sum(a_train_stations$ada == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)

print(num_a_train_stations)  
print(num_ada_compliant_a_train_stations) 
```
21 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that serve the A train, 0 are ADA compliant.
