## Problem 1

This problem focuses on NYC Transit data. Import the NYC Transit CSV.

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
nyc_transit = janitor::clean_names(nyc_transit)
```

Select the required columns

``` r
nyc_transit <- nyc_transit %>%
  mutate(routes_served = apply(select(.,route1:route11), 1, function(x) paste(na.omit(x), collapse = ", "))) %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada, routes_served) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The variables in the nyc_transit data set are line, station_name,
station_longitude, station_latitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada,
and routes_served. The cleaning steps performed so far include selecting
only the relevant columns, creating a new variable routes_served that
consolidates information about the routes served at each station, and
converting the entry variable from character strings to logical values.
The resulting data set dimensions are 1,868 × 9. This is considered
tidy, as each variable is represented by a column, each observation is a
row, and each type of observational unit is a table.

Finding how many distinct stations there are

``` r
distinct_stations <- nrow(nyc_transit %>% distinct(line, station_name))
distinct_stations
```

    ## [1] 465

According to this code, there are 465 distinct stations in New York
City.

Finding how many are ADA compliant

``` r
ada_compliant_stations <- sum(nyc_transit$ada == TRUE)
ada_compliant_stations
```

    ## [1] 468

According to this code, there are 468 ada compliant stations.

Proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

``` r
nyc_transit <- nyc_transit %>%
  mutate(vending = ifelse(vending == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) 

proportion_without_vending <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(vending == FALSE) %>%                              
  summarise(proportion = mean(entry, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%   
  pull(proportion)

proportion_without_vending
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

The output of this code gives us 0.3770492. This means that 37.70% of
stations/entrances don’t have a vending allow entrance.

``` r
a_train_stations <- nyc_transit %>%
  filter(routes_served == "A") %>%
  distinct(line, station_name)  

num_a_train_stations <- nrow(a_train_stations)

num_ada_compliant_a_train_stations <- sum(a_train_stations$ada == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ## Warning: Unknown or uninitialised column: `ada`.

``` r
print(num_a_train_stations)  
```

    ## [1] 21

``` r
print(num_ada_compliant_a_train_stations) 
```

    ## [1] 0

21 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that serve the A
train, 0 are ADA compliant.
